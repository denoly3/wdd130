            Hello! My name is Onya Chinonso and I am from Nigeria. I love playing Ps4 and watching soccer. I am
            currently studying Web Design and Development at Brigham Young University. I am excited to learn more
            about web development and design. I am looking forward to creating my own website and learning more about
            the industry. I am excited to see what the future holds for me.
